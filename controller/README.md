# Controller

# Usage

- The controller is rendered onto a canvas which should be the only element in index.html unless you need an input field or other similar divs
- index.ts (typescript) index.js(javascript) will be the main entrypoint for the controller
- The app() method calls requestAnimationFrame and as such will be updated every frame unless requestAnimationFrame is changed to another method

## Typescript

- After writing your code in typescript, compile it to Javscript using the tsc command.
- Compiled code will be located in the js folder.
